# The Author

Hi, I'm Bernard, better known as [Granitosaurus on stackexchange](https://stackoverflow.com/users/3737009/granitosaurus?tab=profile) and I'm very passionate about web-crawling and Python.
I've been working with web crawling for over 5 years now and I still learn new things everyday!
I'm the most active on stackoverflow forum on web-scraping subjects, I love to help people out whenever I have the chance.

Currently I'm writing a book for [Packt] publishing on web-crawling projects, it should be out by the end of 2019!

You can find more about me at the links in the footer. I'm currently living in Chiang Mai, Thailand so if you want to grab a beer feel free to email me :)
